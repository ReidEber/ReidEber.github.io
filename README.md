Project 1 Elevator interface<br>
The base elevator I used which is filled with multiple faults that make the elevator subpar compared to a more precise design.

To begin with is the most obvious issue with buttons A and B being very lacking in description of what they are. To the average person who may not frequently use elevators how are they to know these are basement floors? How are they to know this isn't the original floors which is barely helped by the small star on the floor 1 label?<br>
Then there are the keyholes which take up large amounts of space instead of in their own space away from the buttons making them an obstruction for the average user.<br>
You may also notice the alarm button is immediately below the door open button which makes it a big issue if someones finger were to slip while pushing a button or if a person isn't paying attention which is fairly common. This could cause an unneccessary alarm to occur when the button would be better off placed elsewhere.<br>
While the issues aren't necessarily completely intrusive they are still issues that could be improved on<br>
